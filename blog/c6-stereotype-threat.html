<h2 id="title">Southern Stereotypes </h2>
<h3></h3>

<p>Bias is a throughly human characteristic. It influences our perceptions, decisions, and reactions. We see life through a lense of our beliefs, and sometimes those beliefs are negative. A stereotype not only impacts the holder, but also the reciepient. The Stereotype Threat affects the performance and life of those who are being judged.  While I have never personally experienced any racial descrimination, I have experienced the stereotypes that people hold against the American South. </p>

<p>I was born and reeared in the Deep South. I was brought up to be, what I believe at least, a fair-minded and non-descriminatory individual. Growing up I had never encountered stereotypes about me, though I did see plenty of bias towards African Americans. For college, I wanted to leave the South to gain a new perspective. Yet, once there I quickly realized that people already held untrue beliefs about where I came from. People believed that I was a bigot. I met many people who assumed that I was a racist just because I grew up in a certain place. There were several times during class that we would discuss issues of race. I had several people tell me that I was a racist during those discussions. I was terrified that they were right. Even after I was reassured by the profesor that I was not, I continued to fear that I was. I was haunted by the ghosts of my cultural past.

</p>

<p>It didn't help that people would make horribly bigoted statements around me. Even growing up in the South, there were many racial epithets that I had never heard allowed. Yet, people felt comfortable being racist around because they assumed that I was. This further entrenched my discomfort, and to this day I am still terrified that I will say something to someday prove those people right. That's Stereotype threat for ya.
