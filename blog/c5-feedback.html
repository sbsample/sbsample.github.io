<h2 id="title">Interaction With Humility </h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4>March 28, 2015</h4>

  Feedback is one of the core pillars of the DBC experience. Learning how to interact and work with others is paramount to building software in a team environemnt, and DBC is focused on ensuring a smooth transition into that environment. Personally, I love both the pair programming and feedback experiences. When I program alone, I can easily get stuck or frustrated due to a mental roadblock. Pairing helps ensure a steady workflow with reciprocation of ideas and workflow control. It is immensely rewarding to build a program with another person and have it run smoothly without much refactoring needed. Conversely, a pair CAN impede progress without excellent communication and a humble attitude. Humility, in my mind is the key.</p>
<p>
  When giving or recieving, humility must at the forefront of every interaction. I have a tremendously bad habit of trying to reason my way out of feedback. "Oh, well, I was trying xyz and that's why I did it like that." I deflect criticism instantly. But if I remain humble and aware that this is a learning experience, I will grow. For example, I realized that some of my feedback was focsued on my experience when driving. I would start to leave the navigator when I thought I knew the direction of the code. I have to be patient and help drive the work flow through mindful action, not just action. Writing feedback is much the same. I have to remember that my pair will not grow if I do not reveal what I see as flaws. We are both teachers and students in the pairing relationship. For them to grow, I must teach. It can be dificult to be honset, but it must be that way.
