<h2 id="title">Conflicts in Traffic</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4>April 19th, 2015</h4>

<div id="textplace">
<p>So we are going to talk about Conflict. Not out in some far land, but how do we face conflict in the most secretive of places. I'll begin by saying that I had a fight with my girlfriend this afternoon. Nothing major, but I got angry. I wasn't angry at her but some idiot who nearly ran into me in the street. I was preparing to merge into the turn lane when some yahoo blows past me and cust me off. I was furious. And I yelled. And I upset my wonderfully sweet girlfriend who is ever so patient with me. </p>

<p>She doesn't like it when I get angry, and neither do I. When we got home she was upset and I had to think about why I was so mad at that kid in the kitted out Prelude. I wasn't angry because he "beat" me or even cut me off. I was pissed because he put other people in danger with his thoughtless actions. He put me in danger. Worse, he put someone I truly care for in harms way. That's why I wanted to yell. Not because of me, but because of her. Yet, even though I feel justified in being mad, I should not have acted in that way. I know that when I lose my cool, be it coding or driving, I no longer think clearly. If I had to do it again, I would breathe and hope that the young man driving so recklessly doesn't end up hurting himself or someone else. I learned that I need to be better than I have been. I can't doe anything about careless or reckless drivers, but I can do something about how I react.
