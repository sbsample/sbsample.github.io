       Welcome to my Technical Blog. I will be attempting to translate my Dev Bootcamp coding experience and distill it into said reading material. Please bear with me as I am a total beginner in both coding and blogging. Though, learning to do both are very overdue.

        Version control. Exciting! No, Really. It's fairly simple to understand, as well as screw up. The whole purpose of version control is to make sure that a developer, or anyone, can work on a project without completely ruining what is good about it. Moreover, programs like Git and Github allow the developer(s) to see who changed what, and when. This means you can ask your coworker why they wrote whatever feature is bugging down your beautiful program.

        Git does the saving, Github does the storage. Git saves versions to your machine. Simple. Github saves your work remotely. The niftyness of Github is the ability to continue to work and push(update) rather seamlessly. You just merge what you want where it most belongs. The value of Github is that it allows you, your teamamtes, or anyone you so choose to download and use or improve your code.<br></p>
