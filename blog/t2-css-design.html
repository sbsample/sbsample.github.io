<p>Anyone familiar with Japanese pop culture will know that there is a trope regarding young men and their rivals. The rival is someone who you respect yet compete fervently with. Now, I'm 31, and am probably far too old to be declaring a boyish rivalry. Should is the optimal word here. CSS, you are my RIVAL! I have a sound respect for it, but it haunts my dreams and makes me grind my teeth. Sounds like a rival to me. </p>
<p> This week I have learned about padding, margin, and border and will now explain it to you. Imagine a football field. If you can't imagine it, google it. Let's say that the players represent the content. They are the letters, symbols, pictures and videos that you see on a website. Around this content, you have the padding. For our football analogy, the field is the padding. When you increase(or decrese) the padding, you are controlling the size of the field within the boundry or lines. Those lines are the border. You can make them thicker, dashed, or different color. Finally, there are the sidelines and endzones. This is the space that seperates the playing field from the stands or stadium. This outer portion is the margin. by increasing the margin you are creating distance between the border and other objects.

<p>  I hope this has been informative and easy to understand. It seems as though it's the part of CSS that's most frustrating. It's easy in principle and dificult in the execution.</p>
