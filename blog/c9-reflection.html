<p>The process of creating my own blog site has been most informative. There has been the trial and tribulations of learning CSS, the revelations about how I feel about design and the attempt to create new features. There are lessons learned in hindsite that should help me develop into a streamlined developer, if that actually exists. I have left my stamp on my first site, and have incoporated the input of others.  </p>

<p>Let's be frank. I thoroughly enjoy the creative process. The design and implementtion of my website has allowed me the ability to finally tap into creativity that has long been dormant. From color choices to layout I have relished the opportunity to unleash my design potential. What has not been enthralling, or enjoyable  for that matter is CSS. I think there are much better ways to implement a website than to do straight html/CSS. I loom forward to the opportunity to be able to streamline my skills.
