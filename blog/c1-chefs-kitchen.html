      Dev Bootcamp offers something that truly distinguishes them form their peers, the attempt to make you well rounded. I know that I could have gone to number of other coding schools, or other avenues, but I chose DBC because they honestly want to turn you into an excited, open minded beginner. So the coding element speaks for itself. I have come to here to create a  new skill set, and make a rather large tack in my life. DBC wants to help me accomplish this with enabling and encouraging transformation from a holistic perspective.

      I just finished watching a video that encourages us “booties” to alter our mindset about learning. We are taught to accept the eat, vomit, and repeat pedagogy from early childhood on. I will not blindly burden myself with that outdated dogma. I will be the creator of my experience. I will not be afraid to fail, and when I do fail I will be bold yet humble in asking for help. I want to be the creator rather than the consumer. This is how I will succeed. Man the Kool Aid tastes good.

Again Soon,

Staunton
