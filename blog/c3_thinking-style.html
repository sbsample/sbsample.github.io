<p>Happy Pie Day Everyone. Possibly may favorite holdiay after Thanksgiving, 4th of July, St. Patrick's Day, and Lent. So, This week's cultural blog has to do with how my learning style fits in with the Dev Bootcamp curriculum.</p>
<p>I am an Abstract Random. This means that I like unstructured but supported learning, I learn through reflection, and that I am governed through my emotions in my learning process. This has led to both ease and dificulties in my time with DBC</p>
<p>DBC's methods have really played in to my strengths. There is a do-it-yourself attitude that guides the program. Yet, there is a tremedous support network if you should need help. This is a significant reason as to why I chose the program. Though, there are aspects of the program that will require me to stretch my Learning Style</p>
<p>Time management and controlling my emotions are both areas in which I can better my experience with DBC. I have not yet been able to effectively time box my projects yet. I have a tendency to underestimate the time needed to finish a project. I expect that this will improve with experience in coding, but I am taking actice steps to better my skills. I am breaking down each task into smaller tasks. Smaller tasks are much easier to estimate time wise. My emotions are another story. I get so unbelivebly frustrated when I cant figure out why my code isn't working. When this happens, I am not able to reason out the problem. I know that I must walk away from the computer and reflect. This is how I learn and must make sure to take my time to digest all that I am doing.</p>

Again Soon,

Staunton</p>
